## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, consider the following steps:

- Ensure that your web browser is up to date.
- Double-check that all three files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`) are present in the project directory.
- Open the browser's developer console (usually accessible with `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`) to check for any errors or warnings.
